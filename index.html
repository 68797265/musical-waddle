            <h3 class="headingThree">A Streetcar Named Desire</h3>
            <p class="aboutmovie">A Streetcar Named Desire is a 1951 American drama film, adapted from Tennessee
                Williams's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1947 play of the same name. It tells the story of a southern belle,
                Blanche DuBois, who, after encountering a series of personal losses, leaves her aristocratic background
                seeking refuge with her sister and brother-in-law in a dilapidated New Orleans tenement. The Broadway
                production and cast was converted to film with several changes. <br>Upon release of the film, Marlon
                Brando, virtually unknown at the time of the play’s casting, rose to prominence as a major Hollywood
                film star. The film marked the first of Marlon Brando's four consecutive Academy Award nominations for
                Best Actor and earned an estimated $4,250,000 at the US and Canadian box office in 1951, making it the
                fifth biggest hit of the year.
